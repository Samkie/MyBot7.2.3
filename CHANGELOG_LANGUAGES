	132=Bots can run parallel at the same time
	133=When running multiple bots, specify how many global threads for image processing tasks can run at the same time.\r\nThis reduces your CPU utilization significantly.\r\nHalf of available logical processors is a good number.\r\nThis configuration is shared across all profiles/instances and a restart of all bots is required (close all, wait, and start all again!).
	134=Global image processing threads will be used for all bots
	135=When images are processed, multiple threads are used. Here you specifiy how many threads this bot can use.\r\nLess threads reduce your CPU utilization significantly.\r\nHalf of available logical processors is a good number. Use 0 for all available. Global threads setting has priority.
	136=Image processing threads will be used for this bot
